# Specification of the Implemented NFFT Functions and Classes

Back to: [Main Page](../../readme.md), [Overview of Fast Kernel Summation](overview.md)

We describe all attributes of the basic classes and functions from the fastsum-related objects. This is currently work in progress.

## `simple_torch_NFFT.Fastsum`

## `simple_torch_NFFT.fastsum.get_median_distance`
